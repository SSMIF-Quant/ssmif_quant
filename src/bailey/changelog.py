# The date is currently november 22. We are in babbio 321. We are all pregaming the christmas party that we are having at Greg's appartment. Can't wait for secret santa. We are watching the Trans-athlete episode of South Park that aired recently. We are supposed to be commenting code, but I think we are checked out. That's why I'm writing this in my...current state. I want to keep the screen professional, but I also want to meme it. We're ordering food. I think we're gonna Ice Greg in his appartment. I should add easter eggs. Maybe add a fun changelog entry. Greg showed Equity the new risk screen updates and showed them the changelog and told them we were building a database. PS Juan doesn't speak english.
